##### TCP-Fit and TCP-Illinois
###### An attempt to implement TCP-Fit and TCP-Illinois congestion control mechanisms for OMNeT++ and INET
---
TCP-Fit was implemented by following the pseudocode and some of the recommendations of this paper: http://www.tcpengines.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tcp-whitepaper.pdf

TCP-Illinois is a port from the Linux kernel implementation at: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/tcp_illinois.c

Both mechanisms reached the final stage, yet use them with caution.

Have fun and keep coding!
